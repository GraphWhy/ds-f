    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    <p>DynamicStory is a website created by a handful of student. Development began January of 2015.</p>
    <p>We created this website because we believe it is more effective way for people to share their opinions than on other blogs or social media sites.</p>
    <p>We saw how limiting other website were. They limited users with a like button, or a simple up and down arrows. They gathered all kinds of personal information on users and decided not to share the analysis with the community.  They limited our reach because we were not popular enough.  DynamicStory works everyday to empower our users.</p>
